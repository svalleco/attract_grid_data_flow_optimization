# attract_grid_data_flow_optimization

This repository contains the following implementations:
-> binned read size throughput prediction (binning_main.py, real_large_data_processing.py, real_large_train.py)
-> throughput prediction on principal components (pca_predict_main.py, pca_utils.py, pca_new_set_generate.py)
-> throughput prediction using the encoder-decoder architecture (encoder_decoder_main.py)
-> Grid World problem implementation (dwave_boltzmann.py)
-> reinforcement learning (RL) framework for the quantum agent (QA) and the environment network (throughput prediction) (agent_main_2.py)

Notes:
-> To run parts of the code, make sure the paths in the files are consistent. A lot of the code has been run on remote machines which had different file paths.
-> There are multiple version of functions which solve the same issues. This is because once more data was available hardware constraints had to be overcome through optimization of the code.
